I'm a first year graduate student at the University of Toronto. My research interests are in stars and stellar evolution, especially massive stars. I'm also interested in computational science and numerical mathematics. Prior to coming to Toronto, I completed my undergrad in physics at the University of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

### Research
TBD, once I do a little more and have time to update this section.

### Resources for Applying for Graduate School

For easy access! Please feel free to contact me anytime about applying to graduate school, deferring admission/gap years, and (slightly) non-standard paths to graduate school.

### Contact
Reach out anytime! I'd love to talk about research, outreach, issues with equity, diversity, and inclusion in physics and astronomy, or graduate school.
